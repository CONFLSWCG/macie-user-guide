## Analyzing S3 Objects Search Results<a name="s3searchresults"></a>

The following section describes the elements of the search results that get displayed when you use the **Research** tab to investigate your Macie\-monitored S3 objects\. 

Complete the following steps in the **Research** tab:

1. Select **S3 objects** in the first filter pull\-down list\.

1. For this sample procedure, select **Top 10** in the second filter pull\-down list\.

1. For this sample procedure, select **Past 90** days in the third filter pull\-down list\.

1. Choose the button with the looking glass icon to start the search\.

Your search results include the following elements:
+ The **total number of results** that matched your S3 objects search for the selected time range\.
+ The **graphical representation** of the S3 objects search results for the selected time range\.
**Note**  
If your data set is very large and you specify a very wide time range, you data might not render properly and this graph might not be displayed as one of the resulting elements of your search\.
**Important**  
You can use the graph to further narrow your search and generate and run a query that will produce a subset of the results generated by your original selections in the steps above\. Double\-click any of the graph's results and your selection is translated into a new query that's automatically displayed in the **Query Parser**, and the **Research** tab is refreshed with the results of this new query\. 
+ **Search results summary** \- this is a list of the most significant fields from your search\. The first line includes the top \(or bottom\) 3 values for each field\. The second line includes the top \(or bottom\) 10 values for each field\.
**Important**  
You can use the fields in the search results summary to further narrow your search and generate and run a query that will produce a subset of the results generated by your original selections in the steps above\. Choose the first or the second line of results for any field, and in the expanded results breakdown, choose the looking glass icon next to any of the results\. Your choices are then translated into a new query that's automatically displayed in the **Query Parser**, and the **Research** tab is refreshed with the results of this new query\.
+ A list of S3 objects that match your search criteria\. You can choose any S3 object to expand it and view its details\.

## S3 Objects Data Fields and Sample Queries<a name="s3fields"></a>

The following tables include the fields that can appear in the results of your S3 object searches\. 
+ The first table includes the fields that Macie extracts from the Amazon S3 object API metadata\. These are Macie fields that are also found in S3 API metadata\. For example, filesystem\_metadata\.ETag describes the entity tag of an S3 object based on the checksum or hash of its content\.
+ The second table includes the fields that are generated by Macie to provide further security intelligence and context based on the examined S3 objects content and metadata\. For example, dlp\_risk represents a weighted score describing the risk profile of an S3 object metadata and its content, or pii\_types describes any personal identifiable information contained in an S3 object\.
